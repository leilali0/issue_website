      <h4>1. Because you’ll save a life.</h4>
        <p>Each year, it’s estimated that more than one million adoptable dogs and cats are euthanized in the United States, simply because too many pets come into shelters and too few people consider adoption when looking for a pet. The number of euthanized animals could be reduced dramatically if more people adopted pets instead of buying them. When you adopt, you save a loving animal by making them part of your family and open up shelter space for another animal who might desperately need it.</p>
      <h4>2. Because you’ll get a great animal.</h4>
      <h4>3. Because it’ll cost you less.</h4>
      <h4>4. Because of the bragging rights.</h4>
      <h4>5. Because it's one way to fight puppy mills.</h4>
      <h4>6. Because your home will thank you.</h4>
      <h4>7. Because all pets are good for your health, but adoptees offer an extra boost.</h4>
      <h4>8. Because adoption helps more than just one animal.</h4>
      <h4>9. Because The Shelter Pet Project makes it easy.</h4>
      <h4>10. Because you'll change a homeless animal's whole world.</h4>
